# Fictional-Sales-Dashboard
Data cleaning, manipulation and visualization of a fictional toy store in Mexico.

Fifty(50) toy stores in Mexico sold over 1million toys and other related products between 2017 and 2018. 
The data, which was in excel format was imported into powerBI and cleaned in power query. Some data manipulations were also carried out in power query.

Data modelling was carried out before creating the dashboard on the report canvas.
Some measures were also created to gather more insights from the data.
Overall, it was an interesting project and very insightful too.

Few Insights from the data:
An average of 22,640 orders were processed per day
Lego bricks in the Toys category was the most sold product.
The Cuidad de Mexico store had the highest sales among all 50 stores.
Stores located in the residential areas sold the least while those located in the downtown areas sold the most, hence the company might want to consider opening more stores in the commercial and downtown areas.
